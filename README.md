# Multithread
This program simulates 100 different office hour instances and reports back data points about the number of students who attended office hours and the length they stayed. Although this assignment was created as part of my school coursework, I took it upon myself to apply multithreading to the problem since it required running 100 separate simulations and during the course of designing the simulation I also realized learning more about the chrono library of C++ could prove resourceful!
